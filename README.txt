# UD_Norwegian-NynorskLIA

This treebank is based on the LIA treebank of transcribed spoken Norwegian dialects. It consists of dialect recordings made in the
  period between 1950--1990, which have been digitised, transcribed,
  and subsequently annotated with morphological and dependency-style
  syntactic analysis as part of the [LIA (Language Infrastructure made
  Accessible)](http://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/language-infrastructure-made-accessible/)  project at the University of Oslo.
