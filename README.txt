# Summary

This Norwegian treebank is based on the LIA treebank of transcribed spoken Norwegian dialects.
The treebank has been automatically converted to the UD scheme by Lilja Øvrelid at the University of Oslo.

# Introduction

The LIA treebank consists of dialect recordings made in the
  period between 1950--1990, which have been digitised, transcribed,
  and subsequently annotated with morphological and dependency-style
  syntactic analysis as part of the [LIA (Language Infrastructure made
  Accessible)](http://www.hf.uio.no/iln/english/research/projects/language-infrastructure-made-accessible/)  project at the University of Oslo. The morphosyntactic annotation of the original treebank follows that of the Norwegian Dependency Treebank, extended to account for spoken language phenomena such as repairs and deletions.

# Acknowledgements

We thank the annotators of the original treebank and in particular Andre Kaasen.
